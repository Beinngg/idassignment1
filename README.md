 NP Rhinos Rugby Club Website

Overview
The NP Rhinos Rugby Club website is a dedicated online platform to showcase the cca, history, events, and opportunities for new members to join. This website serves as a central hub for both current and prospective members of the Ngee Ann Rugby Club (also known as Rhinos) to learn more about the cca, view team photos, and stay informed about upcoming events. The goal of this project is to provide an engaging, easy-to-navigate interface where fans, players, and potential recruits can connect with the ccca and its community.

#Design Process
The primary audience for this website is the cca members, players, and rugby enthusiasts interested in joining the cca. The website needs to provide key information about the cca, such as team details, photos, and membership opportunities. Additionally, it should make it easy for users to navigate between various sections and provide a visual appeal through a photo carousel and simple, clear layout.

User Stories
- As a freshie, I want to learn about the CCA's background and team, so that I can decide if I want to join.
- As a member of the CCA, I want to view upcoming events and team photos, so that I can stay updated and engaged with the community.
- As a prospective member, I want to access a "Join Us" section, so that I can easily sign up or get in touch with the club for more details.
- As an administrator, I want to update the photos and club information on the website, so that the site remains current and relevant.

Wireframes & Mockups
The design process started with wireframes created in Adobe XD, focusing on user-friendly navigation, and ensuring the website's mobile responsiveness. The wireframes can be found in the figma folder (available in the project directory). A link to the Adobe XD share URL will be provided to anyone interested in viewing the design.

 Testing

Manual Testing
- Image Carousel:
  - Go to the homepage and ensure the image carousel is functioning correctly.
  - Click the left and right arrows and verify that the carousel moves through images smoothly.
  - Hover over the carousel and verify that the auto-scroll pauses.

Responsiveness:
  - Resize the browser window and ensure that the website adapts to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, and mobile).
  - Check that images scale correctly, and navigation remains easy to use on smaller devices.

Cross-Browser Testing:
  - Test on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge to ensure compatibility and consistent layout.

Issues Discovered
- Some minor alignment issues were discovered when viewing the site in very small screen sizes, specifically with the carousel images.
- The carousel arrows were initially not working properly when implemented separately in the JS file, but this was fixed by binding the event listeners in the JavaScript code.
